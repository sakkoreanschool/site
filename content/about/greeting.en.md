Welcome to the website of St. Andrew Kim Korean School. The educational goal of St. Andrew Kim Korean School, which has been established and operated by St. Andrew Kim Parish under the Archdiocese of Seattle for over 30 years, is to nurture individuals who emulate God and practice truth, love, faith, and hope in society. Furthermore, we aim to cultivate future talents with sound intellectual abilities, upright character, and moral integrity. 

Furthermore, we aim to educate our students to be inspired by the spirit and life of St. Andrew Kim Daegeon, the first Korean priest. We hope they will grow into happy individuals who pursue their dreams, find their paths, and practice love and service. Our school especially aims to nurture Daegeonians who think and act rightly as members of the international community with broader perspectives and without prejudice through Korean language and culture education. With the interest, love, and dedication of all our staff, we run programs to foster the holistic development and enrichment of our students.

The St. Andrew Kim Korean School community is dedicated to providing a variety of educational programs to cultivate upright character, moral integrity, and rich intellectual abilities, ensuring that teachers, students, and parents all enjoy a fulfilling school experience. Thank you for visiting the St. Andrew Kim Korean School website. We pray that God's blessings and peace be with you, and that you have healthy and happy days.

Fr. Yoonki Park, F. Javier, Principal of St. Andrew Kim Korean School
