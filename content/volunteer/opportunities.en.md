### We’re looking for volunteers!

We welcome volunteers who will work together to build the present and future of St. Andrew Kim Korean School based on their love and interest in Korean school. If you would like to share your talent and love, we look forward to joining you at St. Andrew Kim Korean School at any time!

### Student families and Adults

Families of students can support St. Andrew Kim Korean School during the school session or at any of the many special events held throughout the school year. Any adult family member interested in volunteering can inform us when registering for the semester. In addition, other adults (over 25 years of age) interested in volunteering at SAKS, may contact the school at sakks10@gmail.com.

#### Teacher Assistant (TA)

If you are a high school sophomore (10th grade) or up to college student (age 23) interested in volunteering, consider being a TA, who will be assisting teachers in the classroom and delivering learning materials. TA volunteers must commit for the full school year.

TAs are eligible for various SAKS volunteer opportunities and the “Future Leader Award” from The National Association for Korean Schools. Furthermore, at the completion of the one-year commitment they will receive certification of volunteer hours that may be applied to college applications.

SAKS accepts applications for TA beginning mid-August prior to the start of the school year and individuals will be selected after conducting interviews. Any questions and application inquiries can be sent to sakks10@gmail.com.
